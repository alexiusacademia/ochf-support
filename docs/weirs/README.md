Diversion weirs or diversion dams are vital in irrigation and drainage engineering in controlling 
level of water on streams and rivers.

These are `meter` or `m` for lengths and elevations, `meter/second` or `m/s` for velocity, `cms` for discharge or in short 
for cubic meter per second.

- At the top of the menu is a toolbar consisting of the title, the add document button and the about button.

- To add a new document, tap the add document button, this will create a new item on the list placed at the last row. The item or filename will be "New Weir" followed by a bunch of numbers, these numbers are the timestamp that the file is created.

- On the input screen, this is where the user inputs necessary data for calculation. This is also where the user can change 
the name of the file.
