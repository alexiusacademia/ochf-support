# Pro vs. Lite

For the current version of the apps, all the features of the `Pro` are also present in the `Lite` version. It means you can test out all the functionality of the paid version before buying it using the free `Lite` package.

## So what's the limitation?

Even though the user can use all the features of the paid version, in the free version, there are limitations in the inputs and results of the calculation. The following lists the limitation of the `Lite` version.

- Water discharge input and output is limited to `0.5 cu.m./sec.`
- Water depth in the circular channel shall be `0.6 m` and below.
- Side slope for the trapezoidal channel is restricted to `1 : 1` only.

Having these limitations doesn't restrict the user from checking the correctness of the results from hand calculations.
